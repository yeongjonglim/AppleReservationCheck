# AppleReservationCheck

This is a random idea pops out of my mind where Apple Store visiting now requires reservation with the current COVID situation, and what not it is always not available in Singapore, hence the mini project.

## To Deploy

You need a few things before getting started:
1. Telegram Bot API (You can get one from botFather)
1. Your own chat ID (No demo support at the moment)
1. Automated tool (Jenkins or crontab will do to execute the script for every set interval)

## To start

1. Fork or clone the repository.
1. Run `npm install` on the directory.
1. Replace the environment values with your own Telegram Bot API and Chat ID on Telegram.
1. Use your favourite automated tool, execute the script.
1. You are done!
